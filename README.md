# Aconn

Aconn is an open-source web framework built with Python. It is the first async Python framework to work faster with data intensive Python web apps.

As the framework does not work in a multithreaded way, thus resulting in no risk of overwriting it due to large amount of concurrent requests, the event loop puts them on a que, it uses JSON instead of an SQL database allowing developers to allocate tables faster and more efficiently without losing data.
